# AC Electrics Website - Electricians and electrical contractor 
This is my first milestone project. The website will have a homepage with information about the company and show the services offered by an electrician who specialises in domestic, commerical and industrial electrics. Scrolling down the page there will be a photo slideshow of before and after photos of previous jobs for perspective customers to view. Underneath there will be a contact us section.
The website will utilise the skills I have learnt so far via the Code Institute.
The page will be set up in a way that a potential customer will find helpful.

## UX
The focus of the design is to make a simple and functional website to enable the end user to find the required information they are after and to contact the electrician to enquire about their services.

### End user requirements
As a potential contactor I would like to see what qualifications and skills AC Electrics posesses.

As a customer I would to be able to see photos of examples of works.

As an insurance company and CPS evalutator, to check the correct and accurate information has been provided.


### Objective
To provide a clear and consise resouce for anyone in need of electrical work, by keeping a clean website we can prevent any miss-information.


### Scope and structure
To be able to show off in a straight forward manner the capabilities and be able to back this up by providing a selection of photos of before and after jobs of various different electrical jobs previously undertaken to provide any reasurrance to customers.
The layout of the website has been kept to a minimal, the colour palette used of red and white (just off white) are the business colours of AC Electrics.
Links to Twitter will be used to be able to be used as another verification of validity of the business.
